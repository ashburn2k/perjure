# Welcome to perjure!
This is an example `perjure` entry.

`perjure` is a static blog compiler written in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

It just takes posts in [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net)'s
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format and generates
the blog site structure for you. All you need to do is copy the output to
a standard HTTP server and you're done!
